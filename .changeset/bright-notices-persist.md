Add an opt-in, dismissible global notification banner with accessible severity states and persistent local dismissal across all sites. Each site's root layout now loads active notifications server-side from the sekai-api `GET /notifications` endpoint (via `SEKAI_API_BASE_URL`) and falls back to rendering nothing when the feed is unavailable or misconfigured. The duplicated per-app notification parsers and request helpers have been extracted into shared, exported plain TypeScript utilities in `@platform/ui-shell` (`normalizeGlobalNotice`, `parseGlobalNoticesPayload`, `fetchGlobalNotices`, `stripTrailingSlashes`), with thin per-app adapters owning only private env/config access.
